Easily create wishlists for your wedding, birthday or other occasion.

== Description ==

Are you looking for a clean and simple solution to display your wedding gift registry on your website or just want to create a wishlist for your birthday or other occasions?
WPGiftRegistry easily lets you add gifts to your wishlist and embed it anywhere with a shortcode. Each gift is displayed with an image, a title, a description, the price and a product link. More importantly, people can indicate if they already bought the gift (so nobody else does).

WPGiftRegistry comes with a nice design and is built responsively so it displays nicely on all devices.
